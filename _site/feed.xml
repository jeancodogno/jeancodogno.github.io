        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most important aspects of writing maintainable code is being able to notice the recurring themes in that code and optimize them. This is an area where knowledge of design patterns can prove invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first part of this book, we will explore the history and importance of design patterns which can really be applied to any programming language. If you’re already sold on or are familiar with this history, feel free to skip to the chapter “What is a Pattern?” to continue reading.&lt;/p&gt;
